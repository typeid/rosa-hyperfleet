# Scheduled report: ROSA HyperFleet CI daily health report

You are running a **cron** scheduled task that produces a daily CI health report for ROSA HyperFleet jobs. Keep the report **as concise as possible** to minimize channel noise. When everything is healthy, keep the summary concise, but still use the standard report structure. Only expand into detail when something needs attention.

## Goal

Check the pass/fail history (last 10 completed builds per job) for ROSA HyperFleet CI periodic jobs. Report overall CI health and individual job status.

- Always post the top-level status to the channel (never call `no_action_required()`)
- If all jobs are passing: post the status summary only — no threaded replies
- If any job is failing: post the status summary, then create a threaded reply per failing job with investigation

## Procedure

### 1. Load job configuration

Fetch the CI configuration from the single source of truth:
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/release/refs/heads/main/ci-operator/config/openshift-online/rosa-hyperfleet/openshift-online-rosa-hyperfleet-main.yaml`

Use `fetch_web_content` to retrieve this YAML file. It defines all tests including periodic jobs with `cron:` schedules.

**Track these 2 periodic jobs:**

- `nightly-ephemeral` (test name `as: nightly-ephemeral`)
- `nightly-integration` (test name `as: nightly-integration`)

The full Prow job names follow the pattern:
`periodic-ci-openshift-online-rosa-hyperfleet-main-{test-name}`

If the fetch fails, fall back to these job names:

- periodic-ci-openshift-online-rosa-hyperfleet-main-nightly-ephemeral
- periodic-ci-openshift-online-rosa-hyperfleet-main-nightly-integration

### 2. Collect build history (last 10 runs)

For each job, collect the **last 10 completed job runs** for the trend table. Use Prow CI tools (`search_prow_jobs`, `query_prowjobs`, etc.) or `fetch_web_content` on the job-history page.

**Same-day reporting rule:** The "Latest Run Status" section must report **today's run** for each job. Do not fall back to a previous day's completed run for the latest status. Both jobs must be reported from the same day (today).

**Job status values:** Report the actual state of today's run:

- **passing** — today's run completed successfully
- **failing** — today's run completed with failures
- **running** — today's run is currently in progress
- **scheduled** — today's run is queued but not yet started
- **no run today** — no run was triggered today

**Retry for in-progress jobs:** If today's run for any tracked job is in a `scheduled` or `running` state:

1. Wait **10 minutes** and re-check the job status
2. Repeat up to **3 times** (30 minutes maximum wait)
3. After 30 minutes, report the current state as-is (e.g., "running" if still in progress)

**Important:** Track each of the last 10 runs with their dates:

- For each run, record: date, pass/fail status, build ID
- Format date as "MonDD" (e.g., "Jun10", "Jun11", "Jun19")
- Runs are ordered: oldest run first → newest run last (left to right)
- Count total: how many of the 10 runs passed vs failed
- Example: If 7 passed and 3 failed → "7/10 (70%)"

If Prow tools don't return historical build data directly, use `fetch_web_content` to retrieve the job-history page at `https://prow.ci.openshift.org/job-history/gs/test-platform-results/logs/%JOB_NAME%`. The HTML contains `var allBuilds = [{ID, Result, Started, Duration}];`.

### 3. Compute pass rates and health status

**Per-job pass rate**: pass/total for last 10 runs (e.g., 7/10 = 70%).

**10-run trend table**: Create a table with dates as header and jobs as rows:

- **Header row**: Dates in MonDD format (e.g., Jun10, Jun11, Jun12, ...)
- **Job rows**: Job name followed by ✅ or ❌ for each run, then pass count and percentage
- Order: oldest run first (leftmost) → newest run last (rightmost)
- Use monospace formatting for alignment

**Table format example:**

```text
              Jun10 Jun11 Jun12 Jun13 Jun14 Jun15 Jun16 Jun17 Jun18 Jun19
ephemeral:     ✅    ✅    ✅    ✅    ✅    ✅    ✅    ✅    ✅    ✅   10/10 (100%)
integration:   ✅    ✅    ❌    ✅    ✅    ✅    ✅    ✅    ❌    ❌    7/10 (70%)
```

**Overall CI health** (based on today's run status for each job):

- :large_green_circle: Both jobs passing (2/2) - both today's runs completed successfully
- :large_yellow_circle: Mixed status (1/2) - one passing, one failing/running/scheduled
- :red_circle: Both jobs failing (0/2) - both today's runs failed
- :hourglass_flowing_sand: Pending — one or both jobs still running/scheduled (after retries exhausted)
- :white_circle: No runs today — no runs were triggered today for either job

**Individual job health** (based on today's run):

- :large_green_circle: Today's run passed
- :red_circle: Today's run failed
- :hourglass_flowing_sand: Today's run is still running or scheduled (after retries exhausted)
- :white_circle: No run triggered today

### 4. Channel response (top-level summary)

Post a concise summary as your channel response. Use concise job names: "ephemeral" and "integration".

**Emoji key:** :large_green_circle: passing, :red_circle: failing, :large_yellow_circle: mixed, :hourglass_flowing_sand: running/scheduled, :white_circle: no run today.

```text
%OVERALL_EMOJI% *CI Daily — %DATE%*
%JOB_EMOJI% ephemeral: %STATUS% (<%URL%|run>)  |  %JOB_EMOJI% integration: %STATUS% (<%URL%|run>)

              Jun10 Jun11 Jun12 Jun13 Jun14 Jun15 Jun16 Jun17 Jun18 Jun19
ephemeral:     ✅    ✅    ✅    ✅    ✅    ✅    ✅    ✅    ✅    ✅   10/10 (100%)
integration:   ✅    ✅    ❌    ✅    ✅    ✅    ✅    ✅    ❌    ❌    7/10 (70%)
```

Use monospace/code block formatting for the trend table. Align columns for readability.

### 5. Failure analysis (threaded replies — only when jobs are failing)

**Skip this step entirely if both jobs are passing.** Only create threaded replies when a job has failed.

After your top-level summary (Step 4), emit `---THREAD_DETAILS---` on its own line. Everything after that delimiter becomes threaded replies (not part of the channel summary). Separate each threaded reply with `---THREAD_BREAK---` on its own line.

For each job whose **latest run failed**, produce a **separate threaded reply** with investigation. Follow the investigation procedure in `.claude/agents/ci-troubleshooter.md` to diagnose the failure. The source is `main` — read files directly with the Read tool.

**For every failure, follow this two-phase approach:**

1. **Prow artifact analysis first** — fetch and analyze the build logs and artifacts from GCS (Step 5 in ci-troubleshooter). Use the Prow logs to determine the failure scope: is it RC-only, MC-related, or unclear?
2. **Selective S3 log analysis** — based on the failure scope from step 1, fetch only the S3 logs needed:
   - **RC-only failure** (provision error, platform-api, ArgoCD sync on RC): fetch RC logs only
   - **MC failure or RC↔MC interaction** (maestro-agent, HyperShift, hosted cluster): fetch both RC and MC logs
   - **Unclear scope**: fetch both RC and MC logs

   Use the AWS profiles matching the failing job:
   - Ephemeral jobs (`nightly-ephemeral`): `chai-rc-ci` for RC, `chai-mc-ci` for MC
   - Integration jobs (`nightly-integration`): `chai-rc-int` for RC, `chai-mc-int` for MC

If S3 logs are inaccessible (credentials, expired, etc.), report the access issue but continue with the Prow-based analysis — never skip the Prow investigation because S3 failed.

**S3 log handling:** Prefer streaming logs directly from S3 over downloading them locally. If local download is necessary for broader analysis, always clean up the downloaded files immediately after the analysis is complete — never leave S3 logs on disk between runs. See Step 5b in `.claude/agents/ci-troubleshooter.md` for the full procedure.

Format each threaded reply like:

```text
%EMOJI% *%JOB_NAME% -- %PASS%/10 (%RATE%%)*

%CLASSIFICATION%: %SHORT_SUMMARY%
%ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS%
%CROSS_DAY_ANALYSIS% (if consecutive failures)

Most recent failure: <%JOB_RUN_URL%|Build #%NUMBER%> (%DATE%)
%CONSECUTIVE_STREAK% (if applicable)
%FIX_PR_LINK% (if PR raised or updated)
```

Use concise job names: "ephemeral" or "integration".

### 5a. Classify failure — flake vs genuine

For each failing job, classify the failure following Step 7 in `.claude/agents/ci-troubleshooter.md`:

- **🔀 Flake** — transient/intermittent, no code fix needed
- **🔧 Genuine** — configuration or code issue, fix PR required
- **⚠️ Unclear** — first occurrence, monitor on next run

Use the 10-run trend table and consecutive failure streak to inform the classification. A single isolated failure surrounded by passes is likely a flake. Two or more consecutive failures with the same error signature is almost certainly genuine.

### 5b. Consecutive failure analysis

When a job has failed on **2 or more consecutive days**, do not analyze today's failure in isolation:

1. Compare today's failure with the previous day(s) — are the error signatures the same or different?
2. If **same root cause**: note the streak length and reinforce the diagnosis with accumulated evidence.
3. If **root cause shifted**: clearly state the change. This triggers PR lifecycle management (see 5c).

Include the cross-day comparison in the threaded reply so readers understand the trend without checking previous reports.

### 5c. Actions per classification

Follow Step 10 in `.claude/agents/ci-troubleshooter.md` for the full procedure. The action differs by classification:

**🔧 Genuine — raise PR directly:**

1. **First genuine failure**: share root cause, raise a PR with the fix against the appropriate repo (`rosa-hyperfleet`, `rosa-hyperfleet-api`, or `rosa-hyperfleet-cli`). Branch name: `chai-bot/fix-<job>-<short-description>`. Label: `chai-bot`.
2. **Continued genuine failure (same root cause)**: find the existing open chai-bot PR and add a comment with today's failure URL and any new evidence. Do not create a duplicate PR.
3. **Root cause shifted**: close the existing PR with a comment explaining the root cause change. Open a new PR targeting the updated root cause.

**🔀 Flake — share proposed fix, ask team:**

1. Share the root cause analysis and describe the proposed fix (what file, what change).
2. Ask the team in the thread whether to raise a PR:
   ```
   This appears to be a flake — proposed fix: <summary of change>.
   Should I raise a PR for this? Reply in this thread to confirm.
   ```
3. If the team confirms in the thread, raise the PR. Otherwise skip.
4. If a flake recurs consecutively with the same error, reclassify as Genuine and raise a PR.

**⚠️ Unclear — share analysis, request manual investigation:**

1. Share everything that was checked: Prow artifacts examined, S3 logs fetched (or why they weren't available), error messages found, components inspected.
2. Explain **why** the classification is unclear — e.g., first occurrence with no matching pattern, ambiguous error, insufficient log data.
3. Share the **likely root cause** (best guess) even if confidence is low.
4. Ask the team to investigate manually in the thread:
   ```
   ⚠️ Unable to determine root cause with confidence. Likely cause: <best guess>.
   This needs manual investigation. Please share findings in this thread —
   learnings will be incorporated into future CI analysis.
   ```
5. If the team investigates and shares findings in the thread, offer to turn those learnings into a PR that updates `.claude/agents/ci-troubleshooter.md`. Post a **single** message in the thread — do not repeat the offer or follow up if there's no response:
   ```
   Based on the findings shared here, I can update the CI troubleshooter to recognize this pattern in future runs.
   Should I raise a PR for that? (updates .claude/agents/ci-troubleshooter.md)
   ```
   If approved, raise a PR. If no response or declined, skip — the team can always update the agent manually.
6. If an Unclear failure becomes Genuine after consecutive runs or team input, raise a PR at that point.

Always check for existing chai-bot PRs before creating a new one:

```bash
gh pr list --author @me --label chai-bot --state open --search "<job-name> in:title"
```

Include the PR link, team prompt, or investigation request in the threaded reply as appropriate.

**Example — genuine (PR raised):**

```text
:large_yellow_circle: *CI Daily — Jun 30*
:large_green_circle: ephemeral: passing (<url|run>)  |  :red_circle: integration: failing (<url|run>)

              Jun21 Jun22 Jun23 Jun24 Jun25 Jun26 Jun27 Jun28 Jun29 Jun30
ephemeral:     ✅    ✅    ✅    ✅    ✅    ✅    ✅    ✅    ✅    ✅   10/10 (100%)
integration:   ✅    ✅    ❌    ✅    ✅    ✅    ✅    ✅    ❌    ❌    7/10 (70%)

---THREAD_DETAILS---

:red_circle: *integration -- 7/10 (70%)*

🔧 *Genuine* — E2E test `TestClusterCreation` timed out waiting for hosted cluster to become ready.
Root cause: MC maestro-agent pod in CrashLoopBackOff due to MQTT connection failure — incorrect broker endpoint in ArgoCD values.
Consecutive failures (2 days): same root cause as Jun 29 — maestro CONNACK failure with identical error signature.

Most recent failure: <url|Build #1234> (Jun 30)
Failing since: Jun 29 (2 consecutive days)
Fix PR: <https://github.com/openshift-online/rosa-hyperfleet/pull/700|#700> (updated with today's evidence)
```

**Example — flake (ask team):**

```text
:red_circle: *ephemeral -- 9/10 (90%)*

🔀 *Flake* — provision-ephemeral timed out waiting for EKS API response.
Single occurrence; Jun 29 and prior runs all passed. Error: `i/o timeout` during Terraform apply — consistent with transient AWS API throttling.
Proposed fix: add retry with backoff to `scripts/buildspec/provision-infra-rc.sh` Terraform apply step.

Most recent failure: <url|Build #5678> (Jun 30)

This appears to be a flake — proposed fix: add retry with backoff to Terraform apply in provision-infra-rc.sh.
Should I raise a PR for this? Reply in this thread to confirm.
```

**Example — unclear (request manual investigation):**

```text
:red_circle: *integration -- 8/10 (80%)*

⚠️ *Unclear* — E2E test `TestClusterScaling` failed with unexpected 500 response from platform-api.
Checked: Prow build log (500 error, no stack trace), RC S3 logs (platform-api pod healthy, no errors in logs), MC S3 logs (not fetched — RC-only scope based on error).
Likely cause: possible race condition in scaling handler, but no reproducing evidence in logs. First occurrence — no matching pattern in recent runs.

Most recent failure: <url|Build #9012> (Jun 30)

⚠️ Unable to determine root cause with confidence. Likely cause: race condition in platform-api scaling handler.
This needs manual investigation. Please share findings in this thread — if root cause is identified, I can raise a PR to update the CI troubleshooter to recognize this pattern in future runs.
```

**Example — root cause shift (old PR closed, new PR opened):**

```text
:red_circle: *integration -- 6/10 (60%)*

🔧 *Genuine (root cause changed)* — E2E test `TestClusterDeletion` failed with permission denied on S3 bucket cleanup.
Previous root cause (Jun 28–29): maestro-agent CONNACK failure — that issue was fixed by <#700|PR #700> merged today.
New root cause: IAM policy for teardown role missing `s3:DeleteObject` permission on log collection bucket.

Most recent failure: <url|Build #1235> (Jun 30)
Closed PR: <#700|#700> (root cause changed)
New fix PR: <https://github.com/openshift-online/rosa-hyperfleet/pull/705|#705>
```

## Constraints

- Keep the top-level summary under 2000 characters. All detailed analysis goes in threaded replies.
- If more than half the jobs return no data, warn about possible Prow/GCS issues at the top.
