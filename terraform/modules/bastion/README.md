# Bastion

In ROSA HyperFleet, the Regional Cluster and the Management Cluster are private. The only access to them will happen through ZOA processes.

This module creates an **ECS Fargate bastion task definition** that can be used to launch ephemeral bastion containers for accessing private EKS clusters. The bastion shares the ECS cluster created by the `ecs-bootstrap` module. This bastion should only be leveraged in the following scenarios:

- Emergency break-glass access to the Regional or Management Cluster (note that this is a temporary solution for break-glass that is not adequate since it has no auditing, etc.).
- Development purposes where a developer needs to access the Regional or Management Cluster for debugging purposes.

## Architecture

The bastion uses **ECS Fargate** with **ECS Exec** (built on SSM) for shell access. It creates a dedicated ECS cluster with ECS Exec enabled for session logging.

## Enabling the Bastion

The bastion is disabled by default. To enable it, set `enable_bastion: true` in your environment's config under `terraform_vars`:

```yaml
# config/environments/<env>.config.yaml
terraform_vars:
  enable_bastion: true
```

Then run `scripts/render.py` and apply the configuration via the provisioning pipeline (or manually via `terraform apply`).

## Requirements

Install the **Session Manager plugin** for AWS CLI: [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html)

## Pre-installed Tools

The bastion container includes a full SRE toolkit:

- **kubectl** - Kubernetes CLI
- **helm** - Kubernetes package manager
- **aws** - AWS CLI v2
- **k9s** - Terminal UI for Kubernetes
- **stern** - Multi-pod log tailing
- **oc** - OpenShift CLI
- **jq** / **yq** - JSON/YAML processors
- Standard utilities: git, vim, less, dig, etc.

The tools are installed at container startup and may take ~60 seconds to become available after connecting.

## Usage

### Connect to the bastion

Use the Makefile targets from the repo root:

```bash
make int-bastion-rc    # or: make int-bastion-mc
# For ephemeral environments:
make ephemeral-bastion-rc ID=<id>    # or: make ephemeral-bastion-mc ID=<id>
```

This starts a bastion ECS task (if not already running), waits for it to be ready, and opens an interactive shell. The bastion is pre-configured with kubectl access to the EKS cluster:

```bash
bash-5.2$ kubectl get namespaces
NAME              STATUS   AGE
argocd            Active   76m
default           Active   84m
kube-system       Active   84m
```

NOTE: If `kubectl: command not found`, wait a minute for tool installation to complete.

### Port-forward to Kubernetes services

```bash
make int-port-forward-rc    # or: make int-port-forward-mc
# For ephemeral environments:
make ephemeral-port-forward-rc ID=<id>    # or: make ephemeral-port-forward-mc ID=<id>
```

Select a service when prompted (e.g. `argocd`, `maestro`). The script handles the full two-hop chain automatically:

1. Starts/reuses a bastion ECS task
2. Runs `kubectl port-forward` inside the bastion (bastion -> K8s service)
3. Starts SSM port forwarding (laptop -> bastion)

For ArgoCD, it also fetches and displays the admin password.

### Stop when done

Bastion ECS tasks have a configured stop timeout and will terminate automatically.

> **Cost note**: Fargate tasks are billed per-second while running (~$0.02/hour for this config).

## Troubleshooting

### Logs

View container logs to debug startup issues or check tool installation progress:

```bash
cd terraform/config/regional-cluster  # or management-cluster

# Tail logs (follow mode)
aws logs tail $(terraform output -raw bastion_log_group_name) --follow --since 5m

# Wait for bastion to be ready
aws logs tail $(terraform output -raw bastion_log_group_name) --follow --since 1m | grep -m1 "Bastion ready"
```

### Bastion not available

If bastion outputs are `null`, ensure `enable_bastion: true` is set in your config's `terraform_vars` and the infrastructure has been applied.
