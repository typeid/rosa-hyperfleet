# CI

CI is managed through the [OpenShift CI](https://docs.ci.openshift.org/) system (Prow + ci-operator). The job configuration lives in [openshift/release](https://github.com/openshift/release/tree/master/ci-operator/config/openshift-online/rosa-hyperfleet).

> **Note:** `nightly-m6i` and `nightly-c6i` are pending periodic job definitions in [openshift/release](https://github.com/openshift/release). Scripts and override files are ready in this repo.

## Load Testing (Planned)

Load testing scripts are implemented but not yet wired into the Prow workflow. The `rosa-hyperfleet-load-test` step needs to be added to the `rosa-hyperfleet-ephemeral-e2e` workflow in [openshift/release](https://github.com/openshift/release).

- **Entrypoint**: `ci/nightly-load-test.sh` (will run as a Prow step after e2e, before teardown)
- **Scripts**: `ci/load-test/scripts/platform-api-load.js` (API throughput), `ci/load-test/scripts/hcp-lifecycle-load.js` (concurrent HCP creation)
- **Results**: JSON summaries saved to `${ARTIFACT_DIR}/load-test-results/` (visible in Prow artifacts)
- **Baseline comparison**: `ci/load-test/compare-baseline.py` checks for regressions against an S3-stored baseline

### Machine-Type Overrides

The `ci/nightly-machine-type.sh` script provisions ephemeral environments with non-default EC2 instance types. Override files in `ci/nightly-overrides/machine-types/` are injected via `--provision-override-file`:

```bash
# Run locally with a specific machine type
MACHINE_TYPE_OVERRIDE=m6i-large.yaml ./ci/nightly-machine-type.sh
```

To add a new machine type, create a YAML file in `ci/nightly-overrides/machine-types/` with `regional_cluster.node_instance_types` and `management_cluster_defaults.node_instance_types` overrides.

## Cross-Component E2E Testing

Component repos (e.g., `rosa-hyperfleet-api`) can run the e2e test suite against an ephemeral environment with their PR-built image deployed. See [Enabling Pre-Merge E2E for Component Repos](../docs/adding-component-pre-merge.md) for the full workflow, architecture, and SOP for onboarding new repos.

## Build Image

The CI image is built from [ci/Containerfile](ci/Containerfile) and includes all required tools:

| Tool      | Purpose                                       |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Terraform | Infrastructure provisioning                   |
| Helm      | Kubernetes chart templating and linting       |
| AWS CLI   | AWS account and resource management           |
| Python/uv | Ephemeral provider and scripting              |
| Prettier  | Markdown formatting checks (`check-docs` job) |
| yq        | YAML processing                               |
| promtool  | Prometheus rule validation and unit testing   |

These tools are available in all CI job containers and can be used in scripts run by CI jobs.

## Ephemeral Environment

The [ci/ephemeral-provider/main.py](ci/ephemeral-provider/main.py) script manages ephemeral environments for CI testing. It supports three modes — provision, teardown (`--teardown`), and resync (`--resync`) — designed to run as separate CI steps with tests in between.

1. Creates a CI-owned git branch from the source repo/branch
2. Bootstraps the pipeline-provisioner pointing at the CI branch
3. Pushes rendered deploy files to trigger pipelines via GitOps
4. Waits for RC/MC pipelines to provision infrastructure
5. (Separate CI step) Runs the testing suite against the provisioned environment
6. Tears down infrastructure via GitOps (`delete: true` in config.yaml)
7. Destroys the pipeline-provisioner
8. CI branch is retained for post-run troubleshooting (delete manually via `git push ci --delete <branch>`)

### Running locally

See [Provisioning a Development Environment](../docs/development-environment.md) for the full guide on running ephemeral environments from your local machine via Make targets.

### Triggering the E2E Job Manually

1. Obtain an API token by visiting <https://oauth-openshift.apps.ci.l2s4.p1.openshiftapps.com/oauth/token/request>
2. Log in with `oc login`
3. Start the job:

```bash
# Trigger nightly-ephemeral
curl -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $(oc whoami -t)" \
    'https://gangway-ci.apps.ci.l2s4.p1.openshiftapps.com/v1/executions/' \
    -d '{"job_name": "periodic-ci-openshift-online-rosa-hyperfleet-main-nightly-ephemeral", "job_execution_type": "1"}'

# Trigger nightly-integration
curl -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $(oc whoami -t)" \
    'https://gangway-ci.apps.ci.l2s4.p1.openshiftapps.com/v1/executions/' \
    -d '{"job_name": "periodic-ci-openshift-online-rosa-hyperfleet-main-nightly-integration", "job_execution_type": "1"}'
```

4. Copy the `id` from the response and check the execution to get the Prow URL:

```bash
curl -X GET \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $(oc whoami -t)" \
    'https://gangway-ci.apps.ci.l2s4.p1.openshiftapps.com/v1/executions/<id>'
```

Open the `job_url` from the response to watch the job in Prow.

## Accessing Live Job Logs

When a Prow job is running (e.g. `on-demand-e2e`), you can watch its logs in real time:

1. Open the Prow job page (e.g. from the PR status check link or the job history -- see jobs table above).

2. In the build log output, look for a line like:
   ```
   INFO[2026-03-10T11:41:49Z] Using namespace https://console.xxxxx.ci.openshift.org/k8s/cluster/projects/ci-op-XXXXXXXX
   ```
3. Click the namespace link to open the OpenShift console for the CI cluster where the job pods are running. From there you can inspect pod logs, events, and resources in real time.

> **Note:** Access to the namespace is restricted to the person who triggered the job (i.e. the PR author for pre-submit jobs). There is no configuration option to grant access to additional users.

## AWS Profiles

All CI scripts and the ephemeral provider use a standard set of named AWS CLI profiles. The profile names are the same across CI and local development so that downstream consumers (Terraform, boto3, e2e tests) work identically in both contexts.

| Profile        | Account          | Purpose                              |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `rrp-central`  | Central          | Pipeline-provisioner, SSM parameters |
| `rrp-rc`       | Regional Cluster | API Gateway auth, regional infra     |
| `rrp-mc`       | Management       | Management cluster provisioning      |
| `rrp-customer` | Customer         | HCP creation e2e tests               |

Not every job needs every profile. The table below shows which profiles each job type requires:

| Job type              | Required profiles                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `nightly-ephemeral`   | `rrp-central`, `rrp-rc`, `rrp-mc` |
| `on-demand-e2e`       | `rrp-central`, `rrp-rc`, `rrp-mc` |
| `nightly-integration` | `rrp-rc`, `rrp-customer`          |

### How profiles are loaded

**CI (Prow):** Each Vault secret contains a pre-built `aws_config` file with the profiles that job type needs. Prow mounts it at `/var/run/rosa-credentials/aws_config`. Scripts source [`ci/setup-aws-profiles.sh`](setup-aws-profiles.sh) which sets `AWS_CONFIG_FILE` to point at this file.

**Local development:** The dev scripts (`scripts/dev/ephemeral-env.sh`, `scripts/dev/int-env.sh`) read account IDs from `rosa-hyperfleet-internal` (or a custom path via `RRP_ACCOUNTS_DEV`/`RRP_ACCOUNTS_INT`) and obtain STS credentials via SAML, writing them to a config file with the same `rrp-*` profile names so containers see an identical interface.

### CI Vault secrets

CI jobs still use Vault-mounted credentials. These are managed in [Vault](https://vault.ci.openshift.org/ui/vault/secrets/kv/kv/list/selfservice/cluster-secrets-rosa-regional-platform-int/):

| Secret                                     | Used by                              | Key fields   |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| `rosa-regional-platform-ephemeral-creds`   | `nightly-ephemeral`, `on-demand-e2e` | `aws_config` |
| `rosa-regional-platform-integration-creds` | `nightly-integration`                | `aws_config` |

Each `aws_config` field contains a complete AWS CLI config file with only the profiles that job type requires. To update credentials, edit the `aws_config` field in the relevant Vault secret.

## AWS Account Cleanup (Janitor)

The ephemeral tests create AWS resources across multiple accounts. Teardown relies on `terraform destroy`, which can fail and leak resources. To clean up leaked resources, a CloudFormation-based [aws-nuke-cf](https://github.com/openshift-online/aws-nuke-cf) stack is deployed into each AWS account. It runs aws-nuke on a schedule using an in-account IAM role.

See [ci/janitor/README.md](janitor/README.md) for the nuke configuration, preservation rules, and deployment instructions.
