# Hosted Cluster Teardown (Admin)

> **This procedure is restricted to RRP administrators only.** It requires
> break-glass access to the Regional and Management Clusters, which is not
> available to regular users.
>
> Under normal operation, clusters are automatically cleaned up after 24 hours
> and no manual teardown is needed.

## Manual Teardown

The full teardown flow is:

1. Delete the cluster record from the `clusters` table (RC)
2. Delete the cluster record from the `adapter_statuses` table (RC)
3. Delete the resource bundles via the Platform API
4. Wait for the HostedCluster and NodePool to be removed from the MC
5. Delete the CloudFormation stacks in the customer AWS account

### Step 1 & 2 — Clean Up the CLM Database (Regional Cluster)

Open a bastion session to the Regional Cluster:

```bash
# For the integration environment:
make int-bastion-rc

# For an ephemeral environment:
make ephemeral-bastion-rc
```

Once connected, run the cleanup script below. The script connects to the CLM
database, lists all clusters, and lets you choose to delete a single cluster or
all clusters. It removes records from both the `clusters` and
`adapter_statuses` tables.

</details>

### Step 3 — Delete Resource Bundles (Platform API)

Open a Platform API shell:

```bash
# For the integration environment:
make int-shell

# For an ephemeral environment:
make ephemeral-shell
```

Run the following script to find and delete all resource bundles for a cluster.
It handles pagination automatically:

```bash
read -rp "Enter cluster ID: " CLUSTER_ID
echo "Searching for bundles matching '$CLUSTER_ID'..."
for page in $(seq 1 10); do
  RESP=$(awscurl --service execute-api "$API_URL/api/v0/resource_bundles?page=$page&size=100")
  echo "$RESP" | jq -r ".items[] | select(.metadata.name | contains(\"$CLUSTER_ID\")) | .id"
done | sort -u | while read -r BUNDLE_ID; do
  echo "Deleting bundle: $BUNDLE_ID"
  awscurl -X DELETE --service execute-api "$API_URL/api/v0/resource_bundles/$BUNDLE_ID"
  echo "Done: $BUNDLE_ID"
done
```

### Step 4 — Wait for HostedCluster and NodePool Removal (Management Cluster)

After deleting the resource bundles, Maestro will propagate the deletion to the
Management Cluster. Wait for the HostedCluster and NodePool resources to be
fully removed before proceeding.

Bastion into the MC to verify:

```bash
# For the integration environment:
make int-bastion-mc

# For an ephemeral environment:
make ephemeral-bastion-mc
```

```bash
oc get hostedcluster -A | grep <cluster_name>
oc get nodepools.hypershift.openshift.io -A | grep <cluster_name>
```

Both commands should return no results.

### Step 5 — Delete CloudFormation Stacks (Customer AWS Account)

Switch to the customer AWS account and delete the CloudFormation stacks
associated with the cluster:

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=rrp-customer-dev

# List stacks related to the cluster
aws cloudformation list-stacks \
  --stack-status-filter CREATE_COMPLETE UPDATE_COMPLETE \
  --query "StackSummaries[?contains(StackName, '<cluster_name>')]" \
  --output table

# Delete each stack
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name <stack_name>

# Wait for deletion to complete
aws cloudformation wait stack-delete-complete --stack-name <stack_name>
```

## Force Clean Up All HCPs in a Region

To delete all clusters and resource bundles in a region, create a one-off
Job from the cleanup cronjob with `MAX_AGE_HOURS` set to `0`.

From the RC bastion:

```bash
oc -n hyperfleet-system get cronjob cluster-cleanup -o json \
  | jq '{
      apiVersion: "batch/v1",
      kind: "Job",
      metadata: {name: "cluster-cleanup-\(now | floor)", namespace: "hyperfleet-system"},
      spec: (.spec.jobTemplate.spec | .template.spec.containers[0].env[0].value = "0")
    }' \
  | oc apply -f -
```
