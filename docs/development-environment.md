# Provisioning a Development Environment

Ephemeral environments are short-lived, isolated stacks for developing and testing the ROSA Regional Platform. All commands run inside a container on your local machine (podman or docker) and interact with shared development AWS credentials (central, regional, management accounts).

Each environment gets a unique ID that prefixes all provisioned resources, keeping environments isolated from each other. The ephemeral provider creates a managed clone of your remote branch and uses it to drive provisioning and ArgoCD syncs. To push subsequent changes into a running environment, use [Resync](#resync).

## Prerequisites

The following tools must be in `PATH` for all ephemeral environment commands:

| Tool              | Purpose                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `git`             | Repository operations                       |
| `python3`         | Config rendering                            |
| `uv`              | Python script runner (SAML credentials)     |
| `fzf`             | Interactive selection menus                 |
| `podman`/`docker` | Running the ephemeral environment container |

Port forwarding additionally requires `aws` and `lsof`.

### AWS Account Setup

By default, scripts look for account ID files in the `rosa-regional-platform-internal` sibling repo:

- **Ephemeral (dev)**: `../rosa-regional-platform-internal/infra/accounts/dev/accounts.json`
- **Integration**: `../rosa-regional-platform-internal/infra/accounts/int/accounts.json`

If you have the internal repo checked out alongside this one, no extra setup is needed.

To override, set the env vars `RRP_ACCOUNTS_DEV` or `RRP_ACCOUNTS_INT` to point to a different file. The expected format is:

```json
{
  "admin": "<admin-account-id>",
  "central": "<central-account-id>",
  "rc": "<rc-account-id>",
  "mc": "<mc-account-id>",
  "customer": "<customer-account-id>"
}
```

(Integration accounts omit `admin`.)

Alternatively, set `RRP_AWS_PROFILES_PRESET=1` to skip the built-in credential setup entirely and manage your own AWS profiles (profiles must be named `rrp-ephemeral-{central,rc,mc,customer}` for ephemeral or `rrp-int-{rc,mc,customer}` for integration).

## Provision

> ⚠️ _Ensure your changes are pushed to the remote branch before provisioning — the environment is built from the remote ref, not your local working tree._

```bash
# Interactive — fzf picker for remote and branch
make ephemeral-provision

# Explicit — skip the picker
make ephemeral-provision REPO=owner/repo BRANCH=my-feature
```

On success the command prints the environment ID as well as guidance to interact with the environment.

The region is derived from the environment config (see [Customizing Your Environment](#customizing-your-environment)). By default it provisions in `us-east-1`.

To view and interact with provisioned environments at a later point in time, see [List Environments](#list-environments).

## Customizing Your Environment

By default, ephemeral environments use the preset in `config/ephemeral/` (bastion enabled, single MC in `us-east-1`). You can replace this config entirely for your local development by creating a `.ephemeral-env/` directory in the repo root.

### Structure

The `.ephemeral-env/` directory must mirror the `config/<env>/` structure:

```
.ephemeral-env/
├── defaults.yaml        # Environment-level defaults (optional)
└── us-east-1.yaml       # Region config (exactly one region file required)
```

This directory is gitignored — it only affects your local machine.

### Constraints

- Exactly **one region file** (besides `defaults.yaml`) must exist — the ephemeral provisioner deploys to a single region.
- The region file must define **`provision_mcs`** with at most **one management cluster** (only one MC account is available in the shared dev setup).
- AWS account IDs are injected automatically from credentials — do not set `aws.account_id` or `aws.management_cluster_account_id`.

### Examples

Use default topology but enable bastion and change instance families:

```yaml
# .ephemeral-env/defaults.yaml
regional_cluster:
  enable_bastion: true
  node_instance_families: ["m7i"]

management_cluster_defaults:
  enable_bastion: true
  node_instance_families: ["m7i"]
```

```yaml
# .ephemeral-env/us-east-1.yaml
provision_mcs:
  mc01: {}
```

Provision in a different region:

```yaml
# .ephemeral-env/us-east-2.yaml
provision_mcs:
  mc01: {}
```

### Applying Changes

Overrides are applied during `provision` and `resync`. To update a running environment after editing `.ephemeral-env/`:

```bash
make ephemeral-resync ID=<id>
```

## List Environments

Lists environments you have provisioned from your local machine. State is cached in the `.ephemeral-envs` file in the repo root — you can clear it at any time by deleting the file.

To interact with a previously provisioned environment, list your environments and pass the ID to the relevant command (e.g. `make ephemeral-shell ID=<id>`).

```bash
make ephemeral-list
```

Example:

```
Ephemeral environments:

ID           REPO                                          BRANCH                    REGION       STATE                  CREATED              API_URL                                                      RHOBS_API_URL
------------ --------------------------------------------- ------------------------- ------------ ---------------------- -------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------
6bd2d3d7     typeid/rosa-regional-platform                 ROSAENG-143               us-east-1    ready                  2026-03-19T10:14:23Z https://thfvcunmr3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod  https://abc123xyz.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod

To clear list: rm .ephemeral-envs
```

## Shell Access

Opens an interactive shell pre-configured with regional AWS credentials to interact directly with the API Gateway.

```bash
# Interactive — fzf picker for environment selection
make ephemeral-shell

# Explicit
make ephemeral-shell ID=6bd2d3d7
```

Example:

```
Resolving base credentials...
Fetching GitHub token from Secrets Manager...

ROSA Regional Platform shell

API Gateway: https://thfvcunmr3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod
Region:      us-east-1

Example commands:
  awscurl --service execute-api https://thfvcunmr3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/v0/live

[root@df2f729c21c2 /]# awscurl --service execute-api https://thfvcunmr3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/v0/live
{"status":"ok"}
```

## Bastion Access

Connect to a bastion ECS task to access the Kubernetes API of the ephemeral environment's Regional Cluster (RC) or Management Cluster (MC). The bastion runs inside the cluster's VPC and has `kubectl` pre-configured with cluster-admin access.

> ⚠️ _Bastion must be enabled in your environment config (`enable_bastion: true` in `defaults.yaml`). The default ephemeral preset already has it enabled._

```bash
# Regional Cluster bastion
make ephemeral-bastion-rc

# Management Cluster bastion
make ephemeral-bastion-mc

# Explicit environment selection
make ephemeral-bastion-rc ID=6bd2d3d7
```

This resolves AWS credentials, starts a bastion ECS task if none is running, waits for the execute command agent, and drops you into an interactive shell on the bastion. From there you can run `kubectl` commands against the cluster:

```
==> Bastion task ready
    ECS cluster: eph-f16cec-regional-bastion
    Task ID:     683c1f0af6ae4e1bba3552f2c8215bd3

==> Connecting to bastion...

bash-5.2# kubectl get nodes
NAME                          STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
ip-10-0-1-42.ec2.internal    Ready    <none>   2h    v1.31.4-eks-aeac579
```

The bastion task stays running until explicitly stopped or until the environment is torn down (teardown automatically cleans up running bastion tasks).

## Port Forwarding

Forward ports from cluster-internal services to your local machine through the bastion, without needing an interactive shell. This is useful for accessing ArgoCD, Prometheus, and Maestro UIs directly in your browser.

> ⚠️ _Bastion must be enabled in your environment config (`enable_bastion: true` in `defaults.yaml`). The default ephemeral preset already has it enabled._

### Interactive service selection

```bash
# Select services interactively (fzf multi-select) — Regional Cluster
make ephemeral-port-forward-rc

# Select services interactively — Management Cluster
make ephemeral-port-forward-mc

# Explicit environment selection
make ephemeral-port-forward-rc ID=6bd2d3d7
```

### Forward all services at once

```bash
# Forward all available services — Regional Cluster
make ephemeral-port-forward-rc-all

# Forward all available services — Management Cluster
make ephemeral-port-forward-mc-all
```

Available services per cluster type:

| Service    | RC  | MC  | Local address                                       |
| ---------- | --- | --- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| ArgoCD     | yes | yes | https://localhost:8443                              |
| Prometheus | yes | yes | http://localhost:9090                               |
| Maestro    | yes | no  | http://localhost:8080 (HTTP), localhost:8090 (gRPC) |

The command fetches the ArgoCD admin password automatically and prints it to the terminal. Port forwards remain active until you press `Ctrl+C`.

Prerequisites: `aws`, `fzf`, and `lsof` must be in `PATH`.

## Run E2E Tests

Run the end-to-end test suite against one of your development environments:

```bash
# Interactive — fzf picker for environment selection
make ephemeral-e2e

# Explicit
make ephemeral-e2e ID=6bd2d3d7
```

By default, tests are cloned from the `main` branch of `rosa-regional-platform-api`. Use `E2E_REF` and `E2E_REPO` to run against a different branch or fork:

```bash
# Run tests from a feature branch
make ephemeral-e2e ID=6bd2d3d7 E2E_REF=my-feature-branch

# Run tests from a fork
make ephemeral-e2e ID=6bd2d3d7 E2E_REPO=https://github.com/my-fork/rosa-regional-platform-api.git E2E_REF=my-feature-branch
```

## Collect Cluster Logs

Collect kubernetes diagnostic logs (`oc adm inspect`) from the RC and/or MC clusters in an ephemeral environment. Logs are gathered by a dedicated log-collector ECS task, uploaded to S3, and downloaded locally.

```bash
# Collect from both RC and all MCs
make ephemeral-collect-logs

# Collect from RC only
make ephemeral-collect-logs CLUSTER=rc

# Collect from MCs only
make ephemeral-collect-logs CLUSTER=mc

# Explicit environment selection
make ephemeral-collect-logs ID=6bd2d3d7
```

Output is written to `/tmp/<eph-prefix>-logs-<timestamp>/`. In CI, logs are automatically collected on e2e test failure with `S3_ONLY=true` — logs are left in S3 (to avoid publishing sensitive data) and the S3 URIs are printed for manual retrieval.

> ⚠️ _Bastion must be enabled in your environment config (`enable_bastion: true` in `defaults.yaml`). The default ephemeral preset already has it enabled._

## Resync

The ephemeral environment runs from an ephemeral-provider managed clone of your branch. If you push additional changes to your remote branch after provisioning (e.g. updating a Helm chart or Terraform module), the environment won't pick them up automatically — you need to resync so the cloned branch is updated and ArgoCD syncs the changes.

Resync also re-applies the environment config, so changes to `.ephemeral-env/` are picked up alongside code changes.

```bash
# Interactive — fzf picker for environment selection
make ephemeral-resync

# Explicit
make ephemeral-resync ID=6bd2d3d7
```

## Swap Branch

Redirect a running environment to a different branch or fork without tearing it down and reprovisioning. The environment identity (and its managed CI branch) is preserved — only the source branch being tracked changes. After swapping, a resync runs automatically to apply the new branch.

```bash
# Interactive — fzf pickers for environment and branch selection
make ephemeral-swap-branch

# Explicit — swap to a branch on the same repo
make ephemeral-swap-branch ID=6bd2d3d7 NEW_BRANCH=my-other-feature

# Explicit — swap to a branch on a different fork
make ephemeral-swap-branch ID=6bd2d3d7 NEW_BRANCH=my-feature NEW_REPO=my-fork/rosa-regional-platform
```

> ⚠️ _Ensure the new branch is pushed to the remote before swapping — the environment is built from the remote ref._

## Tear Down

Destroy an environment and all its resources:

```bash
# Interactive — fzf picker for environment selection
make ephemeral-teardown

# Explicit
make ephemeral-teardown ID=6bd2d3d7
```
